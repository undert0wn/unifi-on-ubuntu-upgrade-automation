# UniFi Network Application – Automated Maintenance Script

A robust Bash maintenance script for Ubuntu-based UniFi Network Application controllers.
It performs monthly system updates and UniFi upgrades with zero interaction, while protecting your configuration and verifying service health.

## ✨ Features

- Zero-interaction updates
Pre-seeds debconf to bypass the UniFi backup confirmation prompt.

- Configuration protection
Uses --force-confold to ensure existing UniFi settings are never overwritten.

- Version tracking
Logs the exact UniFi version before and after every upgrade.

- Service recovery
Automatically restarts the UniFi service if it is not running after an update.

- Smart reboots
Reboots only when required (e.g., kernel updates).

- Clean logging
Compatible with logrotate for long-term history without disk bloat.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04

- UniFi Network Application installed from the official Ubiquiti Debian repository

- A user with sudo privileges

## 🚀 Installation
1. Download the script
```bash
nano maintain.sh
```

Paste the script contents, then save and exit.

2. Make it executable
```bash
chmod +x maintain.sh
```
3. Schedule automatic execution

Edit root’s crontab:
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line at the bottom:
```bash
0 3 * * Sun [ "$(/usr/bin/date +%d)" -le 7 ] && /home/YOURUSERNAME/maintain.sh
```

🔧 Replace **`YOURUSERNAME`** with your **actual** username.

This runs the script once per month, on the first Sunday at 03:00.

## 🗂 Log Management

All activity is appended to:
```bash
~/maintenance.log
```

To keep logs tidy, configure logrotate:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/unifi-maintenance
```

Paste (and adjust the path if needed):
```bash
/home/YOURUSERNAME/maintenance.log {
    monthly
    rotate 12
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

Injects has_backup=true into debconf to satisfy the UniFi installer.

Runs:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get full-upgrade -y
```

while capturing the UniFi version via dpkg.

Waits 15 seconds for the database to settle.

Verifies service health using:
```bash
systemctl is-active
```

If `/var/run/reboot-required` exists:

Logs the reason

Issues a 30-second warning

Reboots the system

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

Intended only for native Ubuntu installs
(❌ not Docker, Podman, or other containerized deployments)

Always enable UniFi Cloud backups as an additional safety net

Major UniFi releases that modify MongoDB or other core components may still require manual intervention

This script is designed for routine, incremental updates

Test thoroughly on a non-production system before using in production

## ✅ Result

Enjoy a hands-off, self-maintaining, and always up-to-date UniFi controller 🎉
